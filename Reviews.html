                <h4>Miss. Cris Velon</h4>
                <p>My first experience and have not been disappointed! I train here about 4-5 times a week and find the consistent positive trainers, awesome music and participants who take class create a perfect workout environment. I love that they provide parking validation, towels for workouts, water and most importantly the same group of quality trainers are there to personally get to know you and push you in the right way. It’s a hard workout with happy people! And I am seeing results for sure.  </p>

                <h4>Mr.Yene Jenner</h4>
                <p>This is a fantastic gym!! All the trainers are super nice and take an interest in you no matter what fitness level you’re at. I really like how they give me tips and tricks to get the most out of every workout. I’ve been going for a little bit and am already seeing a big change in my energy levels and body. It’s great! I feel 10 years younger!  </p>

                <h4>Mrs. Oxwell Wero</h4>
                <p>  By far the best facility around. This new location is mint from the staff, to the equipment, to the facility itself. From the ownership, to management, to the trainers, by far the nicest and most knowledgeable staff in the business today. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend (GN) to anyone. I am certainly satisfied thus far and have been blown away by my experience at this new facility </p>
